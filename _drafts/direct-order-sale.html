<p>
    Initially we planned to distribute the speakers through retail stores. However, retail stores expect a 40% percent margin. It is not that retails are evil, they have bills to pay too.  But, we felt adding 40% to the retail price goes against our belief of providing the best value to our customers, and honestly doesn't make us any more competitive in the market of chinese made speakers.
    We wanted to make kickass speakers and sell them at a kickass price. So when you compare them with a chinese manufactured speakers of the same price, it'll be no brainer which speaker provide better value.
    However, making great speakers IS expensive. Premium components and fine craftsmanship come at a premium price. For example, there is no way of manufacturing a driver as good as our drivers at a lower price, because for one you'll need the powerful, and heavy magnet to achieve this low level of distortion.
    In order to pay those premiums, we decided to sell direct and spend the money that would go to retails pockets on making better speakers. So we placed our bets on the internet.
    There lays a challenge though. When it comes to speakers, retailers seem to provide value; what better way to evaluate speakers than hearing them? That is something you'll miss when you buy speakers online.
    On the other hand, you can argue the same thing for shoes, and online shoe sales have been a massive success. Come to think of it, The last 5 or 6 pairs that I've bought all have been bought online. The first one or two orders were a bit nerve racking but then I got used to it, and I've been happy with everyone of them. I think there is something more than luck in play here. I believe it comes from the ability of the online seller to provide adequate information to their customers prior to them making a purchase, so that the product matches or surpasses their expectations.
    When it comes to shoes, it's about high quality photos, accurate description of materials, and accurate description of size in various units.
    When it comes to speakers we believe it is providing accurate and controlled measurements. That's why you see measurements of our speakers and our competitors in our website. At first, we felt uncertain about doing this. We didn't want to come across as a scamy salesman who unfairly trash a competitor's product.
    So we decided to be as open and as fair as possible in our measurements. To show where our speakers stand in the competitive landscape, and to do the best we can for our customers who are putting their faith in us by ordering online without hearing their speakers.
