    <span class="dropcap">D</span>o you feel eerie about computer audio? So did we! Let’s change this.
    Last month, I visited the Vancouver Audio Show. It is amazing to see boutique audio companies now making products to serve the digital music consumer.
    Those companies that otherwise would have clung to the old and familiar world of analog audio had felt the force of the market and are now making music streaming receivers, internet radios, media servers, etc. The truth is everyone is consuming music digitally these days, because having your music collection at your fingertips is very convenient. So there is an explosion of digital audio products, and audiophiles have to adjust to this change too.

</p>
<p>
    At Serene audio, we are all about embracing new ways of enjoying music, and all of which involve a computer one way or another. However, sound lovers like to know how their sound systems work, and computer audio is immensely more complicated than anything that came before it. Just think about it, when you play a song on your computer there is a slew of software and hardware working together to playback your music. The hard-drive, CPU, the memory, the sound card, the music player software, the operating system’s audio subsystem … <br/>Check out Windows Vista’s audio subsystem in the diagram below.

<p>
    Isn’t that mind-boggling? God knows what happens to our music while it is travelling down that pipeline! And there is more! Things like file formats, bit rates, bit depths, digital interconnects, and so on. It’s natural to feel eerie about computer audio. </p>
<p>
    Usually the first step for a computer audiophile to get good sound, is to use a DAC. The reason is the built-in DAC (sound card) on most computers and laptops is sub par. But does an external DAC really help? How bad is your laptop’s audio to begin with? Are all DACs the same? The market is full of them at a wide range of prices. How do you go evaluating them?
</p>
<p>
    Our customers ask us for DAC recommendations, so I decided to review DACs and publish them on our blog. I really want to avoid subjective terms to describe sound, because they might mean different things to different people. Now, there are good measurement standards that engineers use to evaluate DACs, but there are two problems with those measurements:
</p>

<ol class="">
    <li class=" "><p>They are hard to decipher, especially if you are not equipped with the necessary technical knowledge and YEARS of experience.</p> </li>
    <li class=" "><p>They don&rsquo;t correspond well to human perception of sound. THD is a good example of that.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>My solution is a measurement that is easy to understand, because it only spits out one number. It also has high correlation to human perception of sound quality, because it measures things that matter to humans, not the lab equipment.</p>

<p>
    In order to correlate well to human experience, it has to take into account one type of distortion that is arguably the most detrimental to perceived audio quality, Intermodulation Distortion (IMD for short). The reason it is so detrimental is because the tones that are generated by IMD are not harmonically related to each other, so they stand out like an auditory sore thumb!
</p>
<p>The problem with most standard tests is that they use one or two pure tones at a time. This is to simplify the analysis of the results, but it has no resemblance to music. A single note on any instrument has many many tones. Just look at the frequency spectrum of a guitar playing A3. Each spike is a tone. You can see A3 whose fundamental frequency is 220Hz has tones well up to 10,000Hz.

        <figcaption>Frequency spectrum of a classic guitar playing A3</figcaption>

</p>
<p>So I decided to use a multi-tone test that would cover the whole audio spectrum. This would leave no stones unturned. Click to listen to the file, it sounds a bit like a bell.
</p>
<p>
    <figure>
        <audio controls style="width:100%">
            <source src="{{site.baseurl}}/sounds/multitone.wav" type="audio/wav">
            Your browser does not support the audio element.
        </audio>
        <figcaption>Multi-tone test wave file</figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>Its frequency spectrum looks like this:</p>
<p class="">
    <figure>
        <img style="width:100%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/matlab-spectrum.jpg"  alt="Frequency spectrum" />
        <figcaption>Frequency spectrum of a test wave file</figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p class="">The test is conducted by playing back the multi-tone wave file through the device (say a DAC) at a certain volume, and we measure its output. The output will look something like this:</p>
<p class="">
    <figure>
        <img style="width:100%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sample-spectrum.jpg" alt="Frequency spectrum" />
        <figcaption>Frequency spectrum measured from a DAC</figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p class="">As you might have noticed the output of the device has these extra tones that look like grass in between the original tones.
    They are the result of distortions in the signal.
    Now we measure the energy of these extra tones+noise.
    This give us one number that is the total distortion + noise or TD+N.
    Comparing two DACs this way, will tell you which one sounds clearer.
    It&rsquo;s simple.
</p>
<p class="">Higher is bad. Lower is good. It&rsquo;s like golf!</p>
<p class="">This measurement doesn't tell you everything there is to know about a DAC.
    But, it measures what I consider to be the most important in determining sound quality for a DAC, its clarity.
    So I call it the <strong>Sound Clarity Score</strong>.
</p>
<p>It also can be used to measure more than just DACs. So, we are going to measure the Clarity Score for everything that we can think of, and publish the results on this blog.
    Hopefully, we will elevate our knowledge of computer audio, bust some myths, make some people angry, and in the process bring some clarity to the world of computer audio .

<h4 class="footnote">I also should mention I didn&rsquo;t come up with this measurement in vacuum.
    This test was inspired by the work of Deane Jensen (who was trying to achieve the same goal for vacuum tube amplifiers) and others.
    You can find Deane's paper <a href="http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=4719" target="_blank">here</a>.
