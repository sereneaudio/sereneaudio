<p class="">You have probably come across those discussions in the audio forums that quickly causes otherwise reasonable men to end up acting like 5-year-olds. Most of them are a clash between subjective vs. objective schools of thought when it come to quality evaluation. Some people only go by their ears while others can&rsquo;t turn a blind eye on the specs. It is easy to make fun of audiophiles for getting into these heated arguments, but I don&rsquo;t believe they are at fault. Most of the time, there is a real gap between what measurements tell you, and your experience. </p>
<p class="">So why am I talking about this, you ask. Our customers often ask us for USB DAC recommendations, because they want to get the best sound out of their Speakers. So I decided to review USB DACs and publish them on the blog. That had me thinking. The best way to communicate the qualities of a DAC over the internet is by measurements. I really want to avoid subjective terms to describe sound, because they might mean different things to different people. Now, there are good measurement standards that engineers use to evaluate DACs, but there are two problems with those measurements:</p>
<ol class=" lst-kix_9i8r3g79nc5k-0 start">
    <li class=" "><p>They are hard to decipher, especially if you are not equipped with the necessary technical knowledge and YEARS of experience.</p> </li>
    <li class=" "><p>They don&rsquo;t correspond well to human perception of sound. THD is a good example of that; here is why.</p></li>
</ol>
<p class="">I set out to design a measurement that is easy to understand and has a high correlation to human perception of sound quality. </p>
<p class="">In order to be easy to understand, I decided it should spit out one number, not a plot or series of plots. Just one number that tells you how good your DAC is, and how it compares to other DACs.</p>
<p class="">In order to correlate well to human experience, it has to take into account one type of distortion that is arguably the most detrimental to perceived audio quality, Intermodulation Distortion (IMD for short). The reason it is so detrimental is because the tones that are generated by IMD are not harmonically related to each other, so they stand out like an auditory sore thumb! </p>
<p class="">The problem with most standard tests is that they use one or two pure tones at a time. This is to simplify the analysis of the results, but it has no resemblance to music. A single note on any instrument has many many tones.
    Just look at the frequency spectrum of a guitar playing A3. Each spike is a tone.
    You can see A3 whose fundamental frequency is 220Hz has tones well up to 10,000Hz.

<p class="">So I decided to use a multi-tone test that would cover the whole audio spectrum. This would leave no stones unturned. Click to listen to the file, it sounds a bit like a bell.</p>
<p>
    <figure>
        <audio controls style="width:100%">
            <source src="{{site.baseurl}}/sounds/multitone.wav" type="audio/wav">
            Your browser does not support the audio element.
        </audio>
        <figcaption>Multi-tone test wave file</figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p>Its frequency spectrum looks like this:</p>
<p class="">
    <figure>
        <img style="width:100%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/matlab-spectrum.jpg"  alt="Frequency spectrum" />
        <figcaption>Frequency spectrum of a test wave file</figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p class="">The test is conducted by playingback the multi-tone wave file through the device (say a DAC) at a certain volume, and we measure its output. The output will look something like this:</p>
<p class="">
    <figure>
        <img style="width:100%" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/sample-spectrum.jpg" alt="Frequency spectrum" />
        <figcaption>Frequency spectrum measured from a DAC</figcaption>
    </figure>
</p>
<p class="">As you might have noticed the output of the device has these extra tones that look like grass in between the original tones.
    They are the result of distortions in the signal.
    Now we measure the energy of these extra tones+noise.
    This give us one number that is the total distortion + noise or TD+N.
    Comparing two DACs this way, will tell you which one sounds clearer.
    It&rsquo;s simple.
</p>
<p class="">Higher is bad. Lower is good. It&rsquo;s like golf!</p>
<p class="">This measurement doesn't tell you everything there is to know about a DAC.
    But, it measures what I consider to be the most important in determining sound quality for a DAC, its clarity.
    So I call it the <strong>Sound Clarity Score</strong>.

<h4 class="footnote">I also should mention I didn&rsquo;t come up with this measurement in vacuum.
    This test was inspired by the work of Deane Jensen (who was trying to achieve the same goal for vacuum tube amplifiers) and others.
    You can find Deane's paper <a href="http://www.aes.org/e-lib/browse.cfm?elib=4719" target="_blank">here</a>.
