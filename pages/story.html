                            It was more like when something falls and you involuntarily reach out and catch it in mid-air

                        <h2>realizing the problem (and the potential)</h2>
                        <p>It was a couple of years ago after graduating from school when I found myself sitting at my desk and working on my computer;
                            increasingly spending more time at my desk where I consume most of my music.
                            Most of my music collection was stored on my computer.
                            Mind you, I was a bit of an audio-snob, so I had curated an audiophile grade sound system.
                            (I even had my own measurement tools to measure speakers before I decide whether I want to keep them or return them.
                            Ok maybe I'm more than “a bit” of an audio-snob, but I digress.)
                            However, I wasn’t spending as much time with my expensive and beloved sound system as it wasn't desk-friendly.
                            I was never satisfied with the sound I was getting at my computer.
                        </p>
                        <p>I went looking for a computer sound system that would match my dedicated sound system,
                            I did find a very high quality sound card that was designed
                            for professional recording studio environment.
                            However, when it came to computer speakers, they neither sounded good nor measured well.
                            So I tried several studio monitors. Thinking if it's good enough for folks at the recording studio it is surely good enough for me.
                            I found out that flat frequency response (which is an important design goal of studio monitors)
                            doesn't equate with high fidelity sound, but more on that later.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            To be fair, I did find some very good studio monitors, but they didn't meet my size and budget requirements.
                            Finally, I ended up having two big and expensive bookshelf speakers with a dedicated amp on my desktop which was rather unsightly.
                            There was no computer speaker on the market for a discerning listener.
                        </p>
                        <p>I personally believe, it was because up until then expectations of computer audio were quite low.
                            Most computers had sub par sound cards (insert link to post of sound card measurement), and most music was stored in a
                            compressed format with low sampling rate (insert link to blog post about compressed formats) due to limited space and
                            bandwidth. All of this had made the existence of a high fidelity computer speakers pointless.
                        </p>
                        <p>However, this was gradually changing. Online music stores were making high bit-rate music available.
                            At the same time, many quality affordable USB DACs (Insert link to DAC reviews) were appearing on the market.
                            Indeed, speakers were the bottleneck in the path to musical serenity. I knew the potential for excellent sound was there.
                        </p>
                        <h2>coming up with a solution</h2>
                        <p>So, I set out to make my own desktop speakers that would pass my own standards in sound quality without taking
                            too much of my desktop real-estate and budget.
                            I had no evil plans of turning this into a business! It was an innocent DIY project.
                            I immersed myself in studying psycho-acoustics (the science of studying how humans perceive sound)
                            to identify what attributes to the captivating musical experience that one would get from a very well designed sound system.
                            It took longer than I anticipated. After considerable research and prototyping, I arrived at three major criteria
                            They are still the core values of electronic and acoustic design at Serene Audio today.
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                <p>very low distortion and noise of any kind </p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>very wide sound dispersion</p>
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                <p>very smooth and extended frequency response (We had to design our own DSP amplifier for this)</p>
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>No matter how fancy or exotic a design is,
                            if it doesn’t serve to improve one of these three criteria it won’t improve your listening experience.
                        </p>
                        <p> You would think these are simple enough and all speaker manufacturers should have these down by now.
                            You’ll be amazed how many expensive and highly regarded products do poorly on these criteria.
                            For example, the frequency response and THD plot below is of a speaker that is manufactured and sold in USA for $1,800 with rave reviews!<br>
                            You can see a very uneven response and very high THD, the one you would expect from a pair of $100 speakers.
                        </p>

                        <p><i>Measurements are the best way to communicate sound quality over the internet. They are way better than words.
                            That's why you'll see us using them more throughout the website. Better get your nerd on!</i>
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After many prototypes, I finally arrived at a passive design that is the predecessor of our current products.
                            One which you can see a picture of below. I lived with these prototypes for more than a year and they just
                            kept amazing me one song after another with their transparency, big sound stage, and the easy and non-fatiguing sound.
                            I wanted to share them with the world, so I established Serene Audio.
                        </p>

                        </figure>
                        <h2>dressing them up</h2>
                        <p>As you can see in the picture above,
                            they are not exactly the pinnacle of beauty and design yet! One thing you have probably noticed by now
                            is that Serene Audio is as much about beautiful design as it is about sound performance.
                            We wanted our speakers to be beautiful objects that you
                            would enjoy looking at.
                            As Theo Jansen puts it: <i style="font-weight:600">“The walls between art and engineering exist only in our minds”</i>
                            So, we wanted to make sure they set a new standard for desktop
                            speakers not only in terms of sound but also materials and craftsmanship.
                            So after Serene Audio was established in 2010, We spent more than a year on designs and fabrication processes.
                            We were very fortunate to find all the talent we needed, locally, and to this date, majority of our fabrication
                            processes happens in our <a href="/workshop">workshop</a> in Vancouver.
                        </p>
                        <h2>letting them loose</h2>
                        <p>
                            Finally, our labour of love had come to fruition. We had something that we were extremely proud of both in terms of performance and aesthetics.
                            So on December 2011 we opened our doors to the world.
                            We haven't stopped pushing the envelope ever since. Later on we developed our own <a href="/amplifier">amplifier</a>.
                            To some, this might be just “another” product, but we strongly believe they are the best speaker in this category.
                            You will be as proud for owning them as we are for creating them.
