                    You wouldn't want to step on a bridge, if its engineers told you it's standing there by magic, would you?
                    As much as marketing departments of speaker manufacturers like you to believe, there isn't much magic in high performance speakers.
                    Or at least you should hope so, or else you should question the competance of their engineers.
                    Robert A. Heinlein said it best: <i>“One man's ‘magic’ is another man's engineering.”</i>
                </p>
                <p>At Serene Audio we make magic happen by uderstanding what contributes a moving musical experience,
                    and solving challeging engineering problems.
                    Our research has proved to us there are three core characteristic that high performance speakers can't do without.
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <p>Very low distortion of any kind </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Smooth and extended frequency response</p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <p>Wide sound dispersion</p>
                    </li>
                </ol>
                <p>
                    To achieve these goals, we designed our own amplifer, enclosure and driver to tightly work together,
                    and  complement one another. To learn more about each, click on the links below.
                    We should just warn you; things will get pretty geeky from here!

<ul>
<li ><p>Expensive custom-made ultra low distortion driver with under hung voice coil and fast transient response. Ultra low distortion provides plenty of space for each instrument and voice to present itself without masking or being masked by other instruments. Where every instrument gets its own breathing space, you hear all the nuances.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Meticulously designed internal amplifier features a dedicated DSP unit and closed loop digital amplifier which saves the integrity of the signal from the moment it enters the amp to the moment it is converted to acoustic waves by the drivers.</p></li>
<li><p>Smart subwoofer output that automatically detects when a subwoofer jack is plugged in, and offloads the bass duty from the speakers by activating an internal high-pass filter hence enhancing the dynamic range. The built-in subwoofer cross-over makes for perfect integration with any subwoofer if one decides to add one.</p></li>
<li><p>There is more to their curvy shapes than meets the eye. This Asymmetric design of the enclosures helps them on two fronts:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Inside the enclosure, it helps eliminate the creation of standing waves and storage of energy for improved transparency and smooth frequency response.</p></li>
<li><p>On the outside, it minimizes the effect of diffraction waves for a uniform dispersion of sound in the room.</p></li>
